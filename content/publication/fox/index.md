abstract:Historically, the land-based threat to shorebird colonies on Phillip Island, Victoria, Australia, was fox predation. As a result, a fox eradication programme consisting of three phases: knock-down (i.e., 2006), clean-up (i.e., 2011), and post-eradication. In 2011 an effective knock-down was declared, signalling the beginning of the clean-up phase. The purpose of this research is to assess the recovery of six resident shorebird species on Phillip Island following fox removal. The statistical methodologies used are novel for assessing bird species population recovery following a successful predator eradication program. We used citizen science data from 2003 to 2017, extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia. The first analysis method used INLA modelling, which relied on a Negative Binomial distribution for bird counts to look for upward trends in shorebird populations during the fox eradication operation. The second method use changepoint analysis techniques to see whether successive phases of the eradication process were associated with changes in bird population numbers. Four of the six shorebird species investigated responded positively to reduced fox populations over the 15-year study, and all changepoint approaches consistently recognised the start of the clean-up phase, with less consistency identifying the start of the knock-down phase. Since 2006, the INLA models indicate a significant increase in the upward trend of shorebird populations for three of the six shorebird species investigated. Agreement across the four changepoint techniques indicates that changes in bird numbers were associated with the date of the eradication program's clean-up phase for all of these shorebird species. These results demonstrate some promise for these methods to monitor native species recovery during eradication programs.
