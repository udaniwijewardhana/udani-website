title: Trendy - Trend Analysis of Aviation Safety Data

summary: This shiny app will allow the aviation safety data and other associated datasets to explore the trends in terms of counts and rates and flag significant variations. The Trendy app includes quantitative methods for the identification of trends using Generalised Linear Models (GLM) and Bayesian models. GLM is a flexible generalisation of ordinary linear regression that allows for response variables with non-normal distributions. The GLM generalises linear regression by allowing the linear model to be linked to the response variable via a link function and allowing the size of each measurement's variance to be a function of its predicted value. However, the Trendy app allows to explore a Bayesian approach to analyse the aviation safety related data. When appropriate this method can be very powerful in providing better solutions. Bayesian analysis is based on distributions and probabilities as opposed to point estimates and frequencies as done with a classic statistical approach. This provides a credible range for the estimates rather than uncertainties based on long term estimates. The strength of this methodology is derived from its ability to add newly acquired information to prior information when modelling the data.
