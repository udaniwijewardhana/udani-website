title: UDMAD - Shiny Web Application for Single Species Seasonal Spatio-temporal Count Models for Areal Data

summary: This shiny application used areal data to fit spatio-temporal models of seasonal species counts. When a fixed domain is partitioned into a finite number of subregions from which results are aggregated, areal or lattice data are produced. The Besag-York-Mollié (BYM) model, besag, besagproper, and BYM2 (Besag, York, and Mollié, 1991) have taken into account that data may be spatially correlated and observations in neighbouring areas may be more comparable than observations in areas further away. This model incorporates a spatial random effect that smooths the data based on a neighbourhood structure, as well as an unstructured exchangeable component that mimics uncorrelated noise. Spatio-temporal models that account not only for spatial structure but also for temporal correlations and spatio-temporal interactions are utilised in spatio-temporal contexts where species counts are monitored throughout time. We determined the mean expected value of the counts for each fitted model (with 95% credible intervals). This app developed based on R-INLA (Rue et al. 2018) which provides a number of options to model data collected in space and time.
