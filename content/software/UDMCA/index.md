title: UDMCA – A Shiny App for Single Species Univariate Changepoint Analysis

summary: UDMCA is a Shiny web application that allows to visualize changepoints by using Bayesian changepoint techniques implemented in ‘changepoint’, ‘breakpoint’, ‘cumSeg’ and ‘bcp’. To carry out these analyses users simply need to click the buttons that create the input files required, execute the software and process the output to generate tables of values and plots with the results. User can use four Bayesian changepoint methods to identify the significant changes of the abundance level using raw data (abundance/occurrence). Still these techniques allow to detect changepoints for a single location (univariate scenario). Therefore, the data entered by users are considered as a single location data when analyse changepoints. You can access the Github repository to follow the installation instructions from [Github](https://github.com/udaniwijewardhana/PPMCA/).
