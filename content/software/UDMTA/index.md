summary: UDMTA is a Shiny web application that allows to fit single species temporal models and estimate significant factors and the trend. It is addressed to ecologists interested in analysing species abundance/occurrence data but lacking the appropriate theoretical knowledge to use this statistical software is required. This app developed based on R-INLA (Rue et al. 2018) which provides a number of options to model data collected in space and time.
