title: UDMSD - A Shiny app for single species joint models

summary: UDMSD is a Shiny web application that allows to visualize spatial, temporal or spatio-temporal abundance/occurrence data, estimate significant factors and the trend. It is addressed to ecologists interested in analysing species abundance/occurrence data but lacking the appropriate theoretical knowledge to use this statistical software is required. The application allows to fit Bayesian Zero inflation models to obtain significant predictor estimates and their uncertainty by using INLA. To carry out these analyses users simply need to click the buttons that create the input files required, execute the software and process the output to generate tables of values and plots with the results. The application allows user interaction and creates interactive visualizations such as species distribution map and posterior maps. This INLA models could be done only for geostatistical data. You can access the Github repository to follow the installation instructions from [Github](https://github.com/udaniwijewardhana/udmsd/).
