title: "Statistical modelling with citizen science data for local shorebirds on the Mornington Peninsula"
event: "Early Career & Student Statisticians Conference (ECSSC) 2021"

abstract: "Climate change has been identified as a possible threat to the biodiversity of shorebirds on the Mornington Peninsula with specific species vulnerabilities likely to be important in both protected and unprotected areas.

Due to the lack of comprehensive survey data, this study uses citizen science bird counts,
extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia, to determine for which species climate change
is likely to be more of a threat and to determine which species benefit more from protected
areas. In all cases, analyses are conducted using temporal models fitted using the
Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) method.

The trends for six local shorebird species were compared to the Australian Pied
Oystercatcher, with significantly steeper upward trends identified for the Black-fronted
Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel, and Red-kneed Dotterel. Also, while protected areas were
associated with greater numbers of the locally threatened Hooded Plover and Sooty
Oystercatcher than unprotected areas, there was a significant upward trend for Sooty
Oystercatchers which was particularly obvious in protected areas. However, warmer years
saw a significant reduction in bird counts for the Hooded Plover on the Mornington
Peninsula.

This work suggests that, with some limitations, statistical models can be used with citizen
science data for monitoring the persistence of local shorebirds and for investigating
factors that are impacting these data. The results for the locally threatened Hooded Plover
and Sooty Oystercatcher in protected areas are particularly encouraging, although the
higher temperatures expected in the future may adversely affect the Hooded Plover."
