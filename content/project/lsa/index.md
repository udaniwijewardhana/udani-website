Conservation areas are a key strategy for preserving biodiversity, but few citizen science studies have evaluated the effectiveness of this strategy. In the absence of comprehensive survey data this study used citizen science records of annual data for seven resident shorebirds for the Mornington Peninsula from 2010 to 2019 extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia, to assess which species were most likely to be threatened by climate variability and which species benefit most from protected areas. This was done by fitting temporal models using the Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) method. We examined temporal models using Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions and determined that the Poisson distribution provides the best fit, as measured by the lowest Deviance Information Criterion (DIC).

The trends for seven resident shorebird species were compared to the Australian Pied Oystercatcher, with significantly steeper upward trends identified for the Black-fronted Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel and Red-kneed Dotterel. Steeper upward trends were observed in conservation than other areas for the Black-fronted Dotterel, Masked Lapwing and Red-kneed Dotterel. 

The results for the Dotterel species in conservation areas are particularly encouraging. This work suggests that, with some limitations, statistical models can be used with citizen science data for monitoring the persistence of resident shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data.
