Climate variability has been identified as a possible threat to the biodiversity of shorebirds on the Mornington Peninsula and is likely to apply in both protected and unprotected areas. In the absence of comprehensive survey data this study used citizen science bird counts, extracted from the Atlas of Living Australia, to assess which species were most likely to be threatened by climate variability  and which species benefit most from protected areas. This was done by fitting temporal models using the Integrated Laplace Approximation (INLA) method. The trends for six resident shorebird species were compared to the Australian Pied Oystercatcher, with significantly steeper upward trends identified for the Black-fronted Dotterel, Red-capped Dotterel and Red-kneed Dotterel. Steeper upward trends were observed in protected than unprotected areas for the Black-fronted Dotterel, Masked Lapwing and Red-kneed Dotterel. Only the Hooded Plover showed a significant response to temperature, with lower numbers in warmer years. This work suggests that, with some limitations, statistical models can be used with citizen science data for monitoring the persistence of resident shorebirds and for investigating factors that are impacting these data. The results for the Dotterel species in protected areas are particularly encouraging, however, it seems that the higher temperatures expected in the future may adversely affect the Hooded Plover.
